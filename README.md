# Project: Data Visualization

## Introduction

This is the fifth project I had to complete for the Data Analytics Nanodegree on Udacity.
For this project, I had to get explore data related to a PISA 2021 and share findings using simple data visualization tools.

## Main Goal

This project aims at performing all necessary exploratory and explanatory data visualization in order to show conclusions from the data.
A better understanding of the results can be read on the README created for the project (README_for_Project.md)


## What was used

With Anaconda's help, it was used python 3.x, and jupyter.
Regarding packages, it was used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
The following data sources were used:
- PISA 2021 data (download [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisa2012.csv.zip))

## Other

Please, don't copy this project to conclude similar Udacity (or other platforms) courses. I hope, however, that it can help you with some insights
