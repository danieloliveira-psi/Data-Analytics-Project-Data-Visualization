# Exploring PISA 2012
## by Daniel Oliveira


## Dataset: Pisa 2021

This dataset contains answers regarding a survey of 15 year-old students' skills and
knowledge, with around 510,000 students in 65 economies. Due to data wrangling only
answers from 427386 students were used, all of them born in the country of the survey.


## Summary of Findings

This is everything I've taken a note of during visualization of relationships:
- Students who firmly say they study hard for math quizzes tend to also say that it's up to
 them to do well in maths - will show in presentation;
- Students who strongly disagree that it's up to them to do well in maths seem to disagree
 strongly that they study hard for quizzes more than they strongly agree;
- Students who firmly say they keep studying until they understand mathematics tend to also
 say that it's up to them to do well in maths;
- Students who strongly disagree that it's up to them to do well in maths seem to disagree
 strongly that they keep stufying until they understand maths more than they strongly agree
 (and even disagree now! but for a very small amount, we could say it's the same);
- Students who report studying hard for math quizzes have a tendency to agree less with the
 statement that they would try harder in maths if they had different teachers;
- Students who report NOT studying hard for math quizzes more strongly disagree with the
statement that they would try harder in maths if they had different teachers - will show
in presentation;
- Students who report studying until they understand maths have a tendency to agree less
with the statement that they would try harder in maths if they had different teachers;
- Students who report NOT studying until they understand maths more strongly disagree with
the statement that they would try harder in maths if they had different teachers;
- Students who strongly disagree that they would try harder in maths if they had different
 teachers, more strongly agree (than disagree) that they keep studying until they
understand maths;
- Students who strongly agree that they would try harder if they had different teachers
seem to more strongly agree (than disagree) that they keep studying until they
understand;
- Less students starting ISCED 1 at an older age than at the most commons ages (5/6/7)
when their perception of control of their outcomes in math is higher - small differences,
so I won't show this one;
- Most students that didn't skip classes in the last 2 weeks agreed that changing teachers
 wouldn't make a difference for their effort and that they study hard for math quizzes, 
but this last one changes with higher truancy, with more agreeing that they don't study 
hard for the quizzes when they have skipped 5 or more classes, while mantaining the idea
that it's not about the teachers - will show in presentation;
- It's less often to find students that haven't skipped any classes and (reportedly)
haven't studied hard for quizzes but agree with teachers making a difference for their
effort (side note: this seems like a very "passive" student, goes to classes but doesn't
take any effort and "blames" on the teacher) but changes on highest truancy where it's
most rare to find students that "reportedly" study hard for quizzes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I'll only focus on questions that I ended up studying on the last
multivariate plot, which is the one I found to be most interesting once I visualized
the relationships. Althought I'm going to show one more kind of perception of control
question to show the general relationship (since the one I've focused on is somewhat
different). So, just their initial distributions (3, 2 for control and 1 for math work
ethic matters) followed by bivariate relationships between them and the final multivariate.
I won't show the rest because they have mild or similar results, so they won't add value
to the report, atleast not more than what already will have.
I'll change some of the titles and labels to not show the code used for the questions
and some of the answers.
